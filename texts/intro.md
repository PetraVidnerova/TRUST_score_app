Please use this app only if you have a real reason and for research purposes so you do not overload the server.
    
This app is intended only for **demonstration** purposes.

If you need to calculate scores for more papers, please download our script from [GitHub](https://github.com/PetraVidnerova/TRUST_score_app) and run it locally on your computer. Using GPU is highly recommended, also having an access token for OpenAlex will help and speed up the whole process.                
    
Enter a valid OpenAlex ID and press "Calculate Score". Alternatively, you can pick a paper from a selection and press "Go!".
