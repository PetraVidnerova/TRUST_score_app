Please use this app only if you have a real reason and for research purposes.
    
This app is intended only for **demonstration** purposes.

If you need to calculate scores for more papers, please download our script from GitHub and run it locally on your computer. Using GPU is highly recommended, also having an access token for OpenAlex will help and speed up the whole process.                
    
Enter a valid OpenAlex ID and press "Calculate Score". Alternatively, you can pick a paper from a selection and press "Go!".
